Hi, I'm Chenming Tang – a Master's student in Computer Science at Peking University. My research spans various facets of NLP, including grammatical error correction (GEC), machine translation (MT), in-context learning (ICL), and knowledge editing for language models. I'm also interested in innovative applications of NLP in financial domains, such as portfolio and risk management.

I’m currently seeking a PhD opportunity for Fall 2027, and I’d love to connect with like-minded researchers and industry professionals. For an in-depth overview of my background and accomplishments, please feel free to check out **[my CV](https://jamydon.github.io/cv/)** and **[contact me](https://jamydon.github.io/contact/)**.

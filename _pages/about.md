Hi, I'm Chenming Tang – a Master's student in Computer Science at Peking University. Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree at Peking University. My research spans various facets of NLP, including grammatical error correction (GEC), machine translation (MT), in-context learning (ICL), knowledge editing, reinforcement fine-tuning for language models.

👋👋👋**I’m actively seeking a summer research internship for Summer 2026 & a PhD opportunity for Fall 2027, and I’d love to connect with like-minded academic researchers.** For an in-depth overview of my background and accomplishments, please feel free to check out **[my CV](https://jamydon.github.io/cv/)** and **[contact me](https://jamydon.github.io/contact/)**.
